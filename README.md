# RPA_Performer_Bot
Dispatcher is a bot that we create to load some data into the queues/datatables. This data can be later used by another bot called as Performer.  Basically, it is breaking one single big bot (having both functions of loading and performing) into two pieces. One bot loads the data &amp; the other performs over it.
